  <h2>Jason</h2>
  <img width="400" src="jason.png""
    <br />
  <h6 </h6>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd8-_SV-aMs">Chase Theme - Jason</a>
  <br />
  <h4>"A man whose identity is concealed by a crude hockey mask. Wielding various tools and driven by a thirst for the cat-and-mouse chase, his hands and weapons are always stained with blood. He enters his damnation armed with his infamous machete and a chainsaw he found in a cabin"</h4>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>  Jason is the first killer the player gets, and is a closed ranged one, lacking any ranged attacks. He is from the popular horror slasher film series <i>Friday the 13th</i>, but actually comes from the old Roblox game Survive and Kill the Killers in Area 51. He is savage and ruthless, driven bt mysterious motives for his actions. </p>
  <h3>Moveset</h3>
  <p>  His difficulty is 2 stars, meaning he is quite easy to use. His attacks are: Slash, Behead, Gashing Wound, and Raging Pace. His passive, Mute, makes his Terror Radius smaller. You are able to sneak around because of this, allowing you to easily pick off nearby survivors. Because of his "interesting" hitbox, you can be extremely efficent, easily killing off the team. Although, he lacks any ranged abilities, so being far away from Jason can somewhat counter him.   </p>

  <h2>C00lkidd</h2>
  <img width="400" src="c00lkidd.png"
    <br />
  <h6 </h6>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_eDrqnHQAw">Chase Theme - READY OR NOT</a>
  <br />
  <h4>"An adopted son from a single father with childlike curiosity, but with the strength of a monster. He appears as a red, flesh-like humanoid that can kill fast and traverse fast. He is known for his association with a vandalization group called "team c00lkidd"."</h4>  
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>  C00lkidd is the 2nd cheapest killer, costing 900$. He is based of an exploiter by the same name who has hacked multiple games, notably Natural Disaster Survival and Work at a Pizza Place. He has a childlike personality who treats everything as if it was a game. According to the lore, he is the son of 007n7, a survivor in the game.</p>
  <h3>Moveset</h3>
  <p>  His difficulty is 3 stars, so he is slightly harder to use than Jason. His attacks are: Punch, Corrupt Nature, Walkspeed Override, and Pizza Delivery. His whole premise is quick burst of high damage. His burning attacks allows players to get hurt over time, and perhaps even killing them in the process. Although, one of his most powerful abilities, Walkspeed Override, is very high risk, high rewards, because missing your attack is devastating. That downtime is no joke. </p>

  <h2>John Doe</h2>
  <img width="400" src="johndoe.png"
    <br />
  <h6 </h6>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-PB2KxKUcM">Chase Theme - BRUTAL ENIGMA</a>
  <br />
  <h4>"The defunct code of the early days of Roblox courses through their body, consuming his mind as he now only focuses on one thing; to kill everyone in his path. An unstoppable force entering the round with a strategical mindset, he's able to set up traps, summon walls to back survivors into a corner, and leave behind a faint trail that damages those who step on it."
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>  John Doe costs 1000$. He is based off the infamous Roblox myth, John Doe, who will alledgely hack roblox on March 18th alongside Jane Doe. Although, this is obviously false.</p>
  <h3>Moveset</h3>
  <p>  His difficulty is 4 stars, so he is difficult to use since he is a tank that deals slow but heavy damage and mostly relies on set ups in order to produce the most amount of damage. His attacks are: Slash, Corrupt Energy, Digital Footprint, and 404 ERROR. His passive, Natural Malevolence, creates a trail of digital corruption that harms and slows down any survivors who step on it. </p>

  <h2>1x1x1x1</h2>
  <img width="400" src="1x4.png"
    <br />
  <h6 </h6>
  <a href="https://youtu.be/D9tLX2mIxkQ?si=xHkaM6Pndb-fWR45">Chase Theme - DOMINO EFFECT</a>
  <br />
  <h4>"The physical manifestation of pure malice, hatred, and negativity himself; the one who despises no one else more than the former admin, Shedletsky. With the daemonshank in his hands, he can summon beings of rot from the deceased, as well as target survivors from afar, poisoning them in the process."</h4>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>  1x1x1x1 is the most expensive killer, costing 1250$. He is a manifestation of Shedletsky's hatred and wishes to destroy him and anyone else associated. Back in 2007, an urban legend was created in which 1x1x1x1 came from the 4th dimension and hated Roblox for being 3D. This is proven false, since he is just Shedletsky's test account.</p>  
  <h3>Moveset</h3>
  <p>  His difficulty is 5 stars, so he is very hard to use. His attacks are mostly ranged, and lacks any damage potential when fighting up close. His crowd control is fantastic, and can easily chew through survivors standing near generators. His attacks are: Slash, Mass Infection, Entanglement, Unstable Eye, and Rejuvenate The Rotten. He has a passive, Parasitic, that causes every attack to distort and glitch the screen whenever he harms a survivor. Not only that, but causes a poison effect that slowly dwindles the health of the survivor for a short duration. You should beware of his ranged moves and try to be unpredictable as possible. Just like C00lkidd, he can deal high burst of damage if you're not careful </p>
